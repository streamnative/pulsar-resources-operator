// Condition types should indicate state in the "abnormal-true" polarity. For
// example, if the condition indicates when a policy is invalid, the "is valid"
// case is probably the norm, so the condition should be called "Invalid".

// are not a priori known or would not apply to all instances of a given Kind.

// components care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
// from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be
// changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same
// backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API.
