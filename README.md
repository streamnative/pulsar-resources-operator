# Overview

The Pulsar Resources Operator is a controller that manages the Pulsar resources automatically using the manifest on Kubernetes. Therefore, you can manage the Pulsar resources without the help of `pulsar-admin` or `pulsarctl` CLI tool. It is useful for initializing basic resources when creating a new Pulsar cluster.

Currently, the Pulsar Resources Operator provides full lifecycle management for the following Pulsar resources, including creation, update, and deletion. 

- Tenants
- Namespaces
- Topics
- Permissions


# Installation

The Pulsar Resources Operator is an independent controller, it doesnâ€™t need to be installed with the pulsar operator. You can install it when you need the feature. And it is built with the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk), which is part of the [Operator framework](https://github.com/operator-framework/).


You can install the Pulsar Resources Operator using the officially supported `pulsar-resources-operator` Helm [chart](https://github.com/streamnative/charts/tree/master/charts/pulsar-resources-operator). It provides Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Controllers to manage the Pulsar resources.

## Prerequisites

- Install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) (v1.16 - v1.24), compatible with your cluster (+/- 1 minor release from your cluster).
- Install [`Helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (v3.0.2 or higher).
- Prepare a Kubernetes cluster (v1.16 - v1.24).
- Prepare a [Pulsar cluster](https://docs.streamnative.io/operators/pulsar-operator/tutorial/deploy-pulsar)


## Install Pulsar Resources Operator

To install the Pulsar Resources Operator, follow these steps.
1. Add the StreamNative chart repository.
    
    ```shell
    helm repo add streamnative https://charts.streamnative.io
    helm repo update
    ```

2. Create a Kubernetes namespace.
    
    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace <k8s-namespace>
    ```
    >**Note**
    >
    > You can skip this step if you specify a Kubernetes namespace via the `-- create-namespace <k8s-namespace>` option when you install the operator.

3. Install the operator using the `pulsar-resources-operator` Helm chart.
    
    ```shell
    helm -n <k8s-namespace> install <release-name> streamnative/pulsar-resources-operator
    ```
4. Verify that the operator is installed successfully
    
    ```shell
    kubectl -n <k8s-namespace> get pods
    ```

    Expected outputs:

    ```shell
    NAME                                          READY       STATUS           RESTARTS      AGE
    <release-name>-pulsar-resources-operator      1/1         Running          0             2m2s
    ```

## Upgrade Pulsar Resources Operator

To upgrade the operator, execute the following command.

```shell
helm repo update
helm -n <k8s-namespace> upgrade <release-name> streamnative/pulsar-resources-operator
```

>**Note**
>
> Don not forget to apply the latest crd files. Because there is no support for upgrading or deleting CRDs using Helm
> https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations
> You can use `helm pull streamnative/pulsar-resources-operator` to download the chart and unpack it, then apply the crds

## Uninstall Pulsar Resources Operator

To uninstall the operator, execute the following command.

```shell
helm -n <k8s-namespace> uninstall <release-name>
```

# Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through creating Pulsar resources. You can create Pulsar resources automatically by applying resource manifest files  to the Kubernetes.

Before creating Pulsar resources, you must create a resource called `PularConnection`. The `PulsarConnection` covers the address of the Pulsar cluster and the authentication information. You can use this information to access a Pulsar cluster to create other resources.

In this tutorial, a Kubernetes namespace called `test` is used for examples, which is the namespace that the pulsar cluster installed.
