# PulsarNamespace

## Overview

The `PulsarNamespace` resource defines a namespace in a Pulsar cluster. It allows you to configure various namespace-level settings such as backlog quotas, message TTL, and replication.

## Specifications

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required |

Note: Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), "d" (days), "w" (weeks).

## topicAutoCreationConfig

The `topicAutoCreationConfig` field allows you to control the automatic topic creation behavior at the namespace level:

| Field        | Description                                                                           | Required |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `allow`     | Whether automatic topic creation is allowed in this namespace.                         | No       |
| `type`      | The type of topics to create automatically. Options: "partitioned", "non-partitioned". | No       |
| `partitions`| The default number of partitions for automatically created topics when type is "partitioned". | No   |

This configuration overrides the broker's default topic auto-creation settings for the specific namespace. When a client attempts to produce messages to or consume messages from a non-existent topic, the broker can automatically create that topic based on these settings.

### Configuration examples

1. **Enable auto-creation with partitioned topics**:
   ```yaml
   topicAutoCreationConfig:
     allow: true
     type: "partitioned"
     partitions: 8
   ```
   This will automatically create partitioned topics with 8 partitions when clients attempt to use non-existent topics.

2. **Enable auto-creation with non-partitioned topics**:
   ```yaml
   topicAutoCreationConfig:
     allow: true
     type: "non-partitioned"
   ```
   This will automatically create non-partitioned topics when clients attempt to use non-existent topics.

3. **Disable auto-creation**:
   ```yaml
   topicAutoCreationConfig:
     allow: false
   ```
   This explicitly disables topic auto-creation for the namespace, overriding any broker-level settings that might enable it.

## Schema Management

Pulsar provides powerful schema management capabilities at the namespace level, allowing you to control how schema evolution is handled and whether schema validation is enforced. This feature consists of two complementary settings: schema compatibility strategy and schema validation enforcement.

### Schema Compatibility Strategy

The `schemaCompatibilityStrategy` field controls how Pulsar handles schema evolution for topics within the namespace. This allows you to configure different compatibility requirements for different namespaces based on your use case.

#### Available Strategies

1. **UNDEFINED**: Uses the cluster's default schema compatibility strategy. When this value is set, the namespace inherits the schema compatibility settings from the Pulsar cluster configuration. This is useful when you want to maintain consistency with cluster-wide policies.

2. **ALWAYS_INCOMPATIBLE**: Disallows any schema changes. This is the most restrictive strategy, suitable for ultra-stable environments where no schema evolution is desired and strict schema immutability is required.

3. **ALWAYS_COMPATIBLE**: Allows any schema changes without validation. This is the most permissive strategy but may lead to compatibility issues. Suitable for development/testing environments where rapid iteration is needed.

4. **BACKWARD**: New schema can read data written with the previous schema. This strategy supports consumer-driven schema evolution, such as adding optional fields or removing fields. Consumers with new schemas can process data from producers with older schemas.

5. **FORWARD**: Previous schema can read data written with the new schema. This strategy supports producer-driven schema evolution, such as adding fields that older consumers can ignore. Consumers with older schemas can still process data from producers with newer schemas.

6. **FULL**: Schema changes are both forward and backward compatible. Both new and previous schemas can read data written by either schema. This provides strict compatibility requirements in both directions and is suitable for environments requiring maximum interoperability.

7. **BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE**: New schema can read data written with any previous schema in the chain. This provides long-term backward compatibility across multiple schema versions, ensuring consumers can always read historical data regardless of schema evolution.

8. **FORWARD_TRANSITIVE**: Any previous schema can read data written with the new schema. This ensures new data is readable by any older schema version, providing comprehensive forward compatibility across the entire schema evolution chain.

9. **FULL_TRANSITIVE**: Schema changes are forward and backward compatible with all schemas. Any schema in the chain can read data written by any other schema in the chain. This provides maximum compatibility guarantees across all schema versions.

#### Usage Examples

**Development Environment**:
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: ALWAYS_COMPATIBLE
```

**Production Environment**:
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: BACKWARD
```

**Critical Systems**:
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: FULL_TRANSITIVE
```

### Schema Validation Enforcement

The `schemaValidationEnforced` field controls whether producers must provide a schema when publishing messages to topics within the namespace.

- **When enabled (`true`)**: Producers must provide a schema when publishing messages. Messages without schemas will be rejected. This ensures all data in the namespace has a defined structure and is recommended for production environments where data consistency is critical.

- **When disabled (`false`)**: Producers can publish messages with or without schemas. This allows for more flexibility in message publishing and is useful for development/testing environments or legacy integrations.

- **Default behavior**: If `schemaValidationEnforced` is not specified, the cluster's default schema validation enforcement setting will be used.

### Configuration Examples by Use Case

#### Development/Testing Environment
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: ALWAYS_COMPATIBLE
schemaValidationEnforced: false
```
This configuration allows rapid schema iteration and flexible schema validation for experimentation.

#### Standard Production Environment
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: BACKWARD
schemaValidationEnforced: true
```
This provides a good balance between flexibility and safety, ensuring consumers can handle schema changes while enforcing schema validation for data consistency.

#### Mission-Critical Systems
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: FULL_TRANSITIVE
schemaValidationEnforced: true
```
This configuration provides maximum compatibility guarantees with strict schema validation enforcement.

#### Legacy System Integration
```yaml
schemaCompatibilityStrategy: FORWARD_TRANSITIVE
schemaValidationEnforced: false
```
This ensures older systems can consume new data while allowing gradual migration without strict schema requirements.

### Schema Compatibility vs Auto-Update Compatibility

It's important to note that there are two separate schema compatibility strategy fields in PulsarNamespace:

1. **`schemaCompatibilityStrategy`**: Controls schema compatibility for manual schema updates and general schema evolution. Uses uppercase enum values like `BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, `FULL`, `UNDEFINED`, etc.

2. **`schemaAutoUpdateCompatibilityStrategy`**: Specifically controls compatibility strategy when schemas are automatically updated by producers. Uses title case enum values like `Backward`, `Forward`, `Full`, `AutoUpdateDisabled`, etc.

These fields serve different purposes and use different enum value formats, allowing fine-grained control over schema evolution in different scenarios.

## Rate Limiting Configuration

Pulsar namespaces support fine-grained rate limiting controls to manage message throughput and system performance. These configurations help prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair resource distribution across applications.

### Dispatch Rate Configuration

Dispatch rate controls how fast messages are delivered to consumers. You can configure separate dispatch rates for different components:

#### Message Dispatch Rate (`dispatchRate`)
Controls the overall message delivery rate for topics in the namespace:

```yaml
dispatchRate:
  dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 1000    # Maximum 1000 messages per second
  dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 1048576 # Maximum 1MB per second
  ratePeriodInSecond: 1                # Rate calculation window (default: 1 second)
```

#### Subscription Dispatch Rate (`subscriptionDispatchRate`)
Controls the rate at which subscriptions can dispatch messages:

```yaml
subscriptionDispatchRate:
  dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 500     # Maximum 500 messages per second per subscription
  dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 524288 # Maximum 512KB per second per subscription
  ratePeriodInSecond: 1
```

#### Replicator Dispatch Rate (`replicatorDispatchRate`)
Controls the rate at which messages are replicated across clusters:

```yaml
replicatorDispatchRate:
  dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 200     # Maximum 200 messages per second for replication
  dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 262144 # Maximum 256KB per second for replication
  ratePeriodInSecond: 1
```

### Producer Rate Configuration

#### Publish Rate (`publishRate`)
Controls how fast producers can publish messages:

```yaml
publishRate:
  publishThrottlingRateInMsg: 100      # Maximum 100 messages per second per producer
  publishThrottlingRateInByte: 104857  # Maximum 100KB per second per producer
```

#### Subscribe Rate (`subscribeRate`)
Controls how fast consumers can subscribe to topics:

```yaml
subscribeRate:
  subscribeThrottlingRatePerConsumer: 10 # Maximum 10 subscriptions per consumer
  ratePeriodInSecond: 30                 # Rate calculation window (default: 30 seconds)
```

**Note**: Set rate values to `-1` to indicate unlimited rate.

## Persistence Policies

Persistence policies control how data is stored and replicated in BookKeeper, affecting durability and performance characteristics.

### BookKeeper Configuration

```yaml
persistencePolicies:
  bookkeeperEnsemble: 3                    # Number of bookies to use for a ledger
  bookkeeperWriteQuorum: 2                 # Number of replicas to write for each entry
  bookkeeperAckQuorum: 2                   # Number of replicas to wait for acknowledgment
  managedLedgerMaxMarkDeleteRate: "1.0"    # Maximum mark-delete operations per second
```

### Configuration Guidelines

- **Ensemble Size**: Should be >= Write Quorum >= Ack Quorum
- **Write Quorum**: Must be <= Ensemble Size
- **Ack Quorum**: Must be <= Write Quorum
- **Mark Delete Rate**: Controls acknowledgment processing rate (string value, e.g., "1.5", "2.0")

### Use Case Examples

#### High Availability Setup
```yaml
persistencePolicies:
  bookkeeperEnsemble: 5
  bookkeeperWriteQuorum: 3
  bookkeeperAckQuorum: 2
```

#### Performance Optimized Setup
```yaml
persistencePolicies:
  bookkeeperEnsemble: 3
  bookkeeperWriteQuorum: 2
  bookkeeperAckQuorum: 1
  managedLedgerMaxMarkDeleteRate: "10.0"
```

## Topic Management Policies

### Compaction Configuration

Topic compaction helps manage storage by removing duplicate keys, keeping only the latest value for each key:

```yaml
compactionThreshold: 104857600  # Compact topics when they reach 100MB
```

### Inactive Topic Policies

Configure automatic cleanup of unused topics to manage resources:

```yaml
inactiveTopicPolicies:
  inactiveTopicDeleteMode: "delete_when_no_subscriptions"  # or "delete_when_subscriptions_caught_up"
  maxInactiveDurationInSeconds: 3600                       # 1 hour
  deleteWhileInactive: true
```

#### Delete Modes

- **`delete_when_no_subscriptions`**: Delete topics when no active subscriptions exist
- **`delete_when_subscriptions_caught_up`**: Delete topics when all subscriptions have caught up

Configure automatic cleanup of inactive subscriptions:

```yaml
subscriptionExpirationTime: 24h  # Expire subscriptions inactive for 24 hours
```

## Security and Validation

### Message Encryption

Enforce encryption for all messages in the namespace:

```yaml
encryptionRequired: true  # All messages must be encrypted
```

### Producer Validation

Enable producer name validation:

```yaml
validateProducerName: true  # Enforce naming conventions for producers
```

### Subscription Authentication

Configure subscription authentication mode:

```yaml
subscriptionAuthMode: "Prefix"  # Options: "None", "Prefix"
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Schema Auto-Update

Control automatic schema updates:

```yaml
isAllowAutoUpdateSchema: true
schemaAutoUpdateCompatibilityStrategy: "Backward"  # Options: AutoUpdateDisabled, Backward, Forward, Full, AlwaysCompatible, BackwardTransitive, ForwardTransitive, FullTransitive
```

**Note**: The `schemaAutoUpdateCompatibilityStrategy` uses different enum values than `schemaCompatibilityStrategy`. While `schemaCompatibilityStrategy` uses uppercase values like `BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, `FULL`, etc., `schemaAutoUpdateCompatibilityStrategy` uses title case values like `Backward`, `Forward`, `Full`, etc.

### Anti-Affinity Groups

Distribute namespaces across different brokers:

```yaml
antiAffinityGroup: "critical-workload"  # Namespaces with same group placed on different brokers
```

### Custom Properties

Add custom metadata to the namespace:

```yaml
properties:
  environment: "production"
  team: "data-platform"
  costCenter: "engineering"
```

## replicationClusters vs geoReplicationRefs

The `replicationClusters` and `geoReplicationRefs` fields serve different purposes in configuring replication for a Pulsar namespace:

1. `replicationClusters`:
   - Use this when replicating data between clusters within the same Pulsar instance.
   - It's a simple list of cluster names to which the namespace should be replicated.
   - This is suitable for scenarios where all clusters are managed by the same Pulsar instance and have direct connectivity.
   - Example use case: Replicating data between regions within a single Pulsar instance.

2. `geoReplicationRefs`:
   - Use this when setting up geo-replication between separate Pulsar instances.
   - It references PulsarGeoReplication resources, which contain more detailed configuration for connecting to external Pulsar clusters.
   - This is appropriate for scenarios involving separate Pulsar deployments, possibly in different data centers or cloud providers.
   - Example use case: Replicating data between two independent Pulsar instancesin different geographical locations.

Choose `replicationClusters` for simpler, intra-instance replication, and `geoReplicationRefs` for more complex, inter-instance geo-replication scenarios. These fields are mutually exclusive; use only one depending on your replication requirements.

## Infinite Retention Configuration

The `retentionTime` and `retentionSize` fields support infinite retention by using the special value `"-1"`. This is equivalent to passing -1 to Pulsar admin APIs and provides unlimited retention capabilities for all topics within the namespace.

### Infinite Retention Time

To set infinite retention time for the namespace, use the value `"-1"` for the `retentionTime` field:

```yaml
spec:
  retentionTime: "-1"  # Messages will be retained indefinitely regardless of age
  retentionSize: "100Gi"  # Still limited by size
```

### Infinite Retention Size

To set infinite retention size for the namespace, use the value `"-1"` for the `retentionSize` field:

```yaml
spec:
  retentionTime: "30d"  # Still limited by time
  retentionSize: "-1"  # No size limit for message retention
```

### Complete Infinite Retention

For completely unlimited retention (both time and size), set both fields to `"-1"`:

```yaml
spec:
  retentionTime: "-1"  # Infinite time retention
  retentionSize: "-1"  # Infinite size retention
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `"-1"` value is case-sensitive and must be quoted in YAML
- Infinite retention should be used carefully as it can lead to unlimited storage consumption
- Retention quota must exceed configured backlog quota for the namespace
- These settings apply to all topics within the namespace by default
- Individual topics can override namespace-level retention settings
- Consider the storage and cost implications before enabling infinite retention

## Create A Pulsar Namespace

1. Define a namespace named `test-tenant/testns` by using the YAML file and save the YAML file `namespace.yaml`.
```yaml
apiVersion: resource.streamnative.io/v1alpha1
kind: PulsarNamespace
metadata:
  name: test-pulsar-namespace
  namespace: test
spec:
  name: test-tenant/testns
  connectionRef:
    name: test-pulsar-connection
  backlogQuotaLimitSize: 1Gi
  backlogQuotaLimitTime: 24h
  bundles: 16
  messageTTL: 1h
  
  # Schema management configuration
  # schemaCompatibilityStrategy: BACKWARD
  # schemaValidationEnforced: true
  
  # Rate limiting configuration
  # dispatchRate:
  #   dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 1000
  #   dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 1048576
  #   ratePeriodInSecond: 1
  # subscriptionDispatchRate:
  #   dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 500
  #   dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 524288
  # replicatorDispatchRate:
  #   dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 200
  #   dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 262144
  # publishRate:
  #   publishThrottlingRateInMsg: 100
  #   publishThrottlingRateInByte: 104857
  # subscribeRate:
  #   subscribeThrottlingRatePerConsumer: 10
  #   ratePeriodInSecond: 30
  
  # Persistence configuration
  # persistencePolicies:
  #   bookkeeperEnsemble: 3
  #   bookkeeperWriteQuorum: 2
  #   bookkeeperAckQuorum: 2
  #   managedLedgerMaxMarkDeleteRate: "1.0"
  
  # Topic management
  # compactionThreshold: 104857600
  # inactiveTopicPolicies:
  #   inactiveTopicDeleteMode: "delete_when_no_subscriptions"
  #   maxInactiveDurationInSeconds: 3600
  #   deleteWhileInactive: true
  # subscriptionExpirationTime: 24h
  
  # Security and validation
  # encryptionRequired: false
  # validateProducerName: false
  # subscriptionAuthMode: "None"
  
  # Advanced configuration
  # isAllowAutoUpdateSchema: false
  # schemaAutoUpdateCompatibilityStrategy: "Backward"
  # antiAffinityGroup: "default"
  # properties:
  #   environment: "test"
  #   team: "platform"
  
  # Basic namespace policies (commented for reference)
  # backlogQuotaRetentionPolicy: producer_request_hold
  # maxProducersPerTopic: 2
  # maxConsumersPerTopic: 2
  # maxConsumersPerSubscription: 2
  # retentionTime: 20h    # or "-1" for infinite retention time
  # retentionSize: 2Gi    # or "-1" for infinite retention size
  # lifecyclePolicy: CleanUpAfterDeletion
  # topicAutoCreationConfig:
  #   allow: true
  #   type: "partitioned"
  #   partitions: 4
```

2. Apply the YAML file to create the namespace.

```shell
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

3. Check the resource status. When column Ready is true, it indicates the resource is created successfully in the pulsar cluster

```shell
kubectl -n test get pulsarnamespace.resource.streamnative.io
```

```shell
NAME                    RESOURCE_NAME        GENERATION   OBSERVED_GENERATION   READY
test-pulsar-namespace   test-tenant/testns   1            1                     True
```

## Update A Pulsar Namespace

You can update the namespace policies by editing the `namespace.yaml` file and then applying it again using `kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml`. This allows you to modify various settings of the Pulsar namespace.

Please note the following important points:

1. The fields `name` and `bundles` cannot be updated after the namespace is created. These are immutable properties of the namespace.

2. Most fields can be modified after namespace creation, including:
   - **Message and Quota Policies**: `backlogQuotaLimitSize`, `backlogQuotaLimitTime`, `messageTTL`, `retentionTime`, `retentionSize`
   - **Consumer/Producer Limits**: `maxProducersPerTopic`, `maxConsumersPerTopic`, `maxConsumersPerSubscription`
   - **Rate Limiting**: `dispatchRate`, `subscriptionDispatchRate`, `replicatorDispatchRate`, `publishRate`, `subscribeRate`
   - **Schema Management**: `schemaCompatibilityStrategy`, `schemaValidationEnforced`, `isAllowAutoUpdateSchema`, `schemaAutoUpdateCompatibilityStrategy` (note: uses different enum values than `schemaCompatibilityStrategy`)
   - **Topic Management**: `topicAutoCreationConfig`, `compactionThreshold`, `inactiveTopicPolicies`, `subscriptionExpirationTime`
   - **Security**: `encryptionRequired`, `validateProducerName`, `subscriptionAuthMode`
   - **Advanced Settings**: `persistencePolicies`, `antiAffinityGroup`, `properties`

3. If you want to change the `connectionRef`, ensure that the new PulsarConnection resource exists and is properly configured. Changing the `connectionRef` can have significant implications:

   - If the new PulsarConnection refers to the same Pulsar cluster (i.e., the admin and broker URLs are the same), the namespace will remain in its original location. The operator will simply use the new connection details to manage the existing namespace.

   - If the new PulsarConnection points to a different Pulsar cluster (i.e., different admin and broker URLs), the operator will attempt to create a new namespace with the same configuration in the new cluster. The original namespace in the old cluster will not be automatically deleted.

   Be cautious when changing the `connectionRef`, especially if it points to a new cluster, as this can lead to namespace duplication across clusters. Always verify the intended behavior and manage any cleanup of the old namespace if necessary.

4. Changes to `lifecyclePolicy` will only affect what happens when the PulsarNamespace resource is deleted, not the current state of the namespace.

5. After applying changes, you can check the status of the update using:
   ```shell
   kubectl -n test get pulsarnamespace.resource.streamnative.io test-pulsar-namespace
   ```
   The `OBSERVED_GENERATION` should increment, and `READY` should become `True` when the update is complete.

6. Be cautious when updating namespace policies, as changes may affect existing producers and consumers. It's recommended to test changes in a non-production environment first.

7. **Important Notes for New Fields**:
   - **Rate Limiting Changes**: Updating rate limiting policies (`dispatchRate`, `publishRate`, etc.) will immediately affect message throughput. Monitor your applications after changes.
   - **Persistence Policy Changes**: Modifications to `persistencePolicies` only affect new ledgers; existing data remains with previous settings.
   - **Security Policy Changes**: Enabling `encryptionRequired` will reject unencrypted messages immediately; ensure all producers support encryption before enabling.
   - **Topic Management Changes**: `inactiveTopicPolicies` changes will affect topic cleanup behavior; review existing topics before applying aggressive cleanup policies.

## Delete A Pulsar Namespace

To delete a PulsarNamespace resource, use the following kubectl command:

```shell
kubectl -n test delete pulsarnamespace.resource.streamnative.io test-pulsar-namespace
```

Please be noticed, when you delete the namespace, the real namespace will still exist if the `lifecyclePolicy` is `KeepAfterDeletion`
