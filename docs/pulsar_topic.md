# PulsarTopic

## Overview

The `PulsarTopic` resource defines a topic in a Pulsar cluster. It allows you to configure various topic-level settings such as persistence, partitions, retention policies, and schema information. This resource is part of the Pulsar Resources Operator, which enables declarative management of Pulsar resources using Kubernetes custom resources.

## replicationClusters vs geoReplicationRefs

The `replicationClusters` and `geoReplicationRefs` fields serve different purposes in configuring replication for a Pulsar topic:

1. `replicationClusters`:
   - Use this when replicating data between clusters within the same Pulsar instance.
   - It's a simple list of cluster names to which the topic should be replicated.
   - This is suitable for scenarios where all clusters are managed by the same Pulsar instance and have direct connectivity.
   - Example use case: Replicating data between regions within a single Pulsar instance.

2. `geoReplicationRefs`:
   - Use this when setting up geo-replication between separate Pulsar instances.
   - It references PulsarGeoReplication resources, which contain more detailed configuration for connecting to external Pulsar clusters.
   - This is appropriate for scenarios involving separate Pulsar deployments, possibly in different data centers or cloud providers.
   - Example use case: Replicating data between two independent Pulsar instancesin different geographical locations.

Choose `replicationClusters` for simpler, intra-instance replication, and `geoReplicationRefs` for more complex, inter-instance geo-replication scenarios. These fields are mutually exclusive; use only one depending on your replication requirements.

## Infinite Retention Configuration

The `retentionTime` and `retentionSize` fields support infinite retention by using the special value `"-1"`. This is equivalent to passing -1 to Pulsar admin APIs and provides unlimited retention capabilities.

### Infinite Retention Time

To set infinite retention time, use the value `"-1"` for the `retentionTime` field:

```yaml
spec:
  retentionTime: "-1"  # Messages will be retained indefinitely regardless of age
  retentionSize: "10Gi"  # Still limited by size
```

### Infinite Retention Size

To set infinite retention size, use the value `"-1"` for the `retentionSize` field:

```yaml
spec:
  retentionTime: "7d"  # Still limited by time
  retentionSize: "-1"  # No size limit for message retention
```

### Complete Infinite Retention

For completely unlimited retention (both time and size), set both fields to `"-1"`:

```yaml
spec:
  retentionTime: "-1"  # Infinite time retention
  retentionSize: "-1"  # Infinite size retention
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `"-1"` value is case-sensitive and must be quoted in YAML
- Infinite retention should be used carefully as it can lead to unlimited storage consumption
- Retention quota must exceed configured backlog quota for the topic
- Consider the storage and cost implications before enabling infinite retention

## Create A Pulsar Topic

1. Define a topic named `persistent://test-tenant/testns/topic123` by using the YAML file and save the YAML file `topic.yaml`.
```yaml
apiVersion: resource.streamnative.io/v1alpha1
kind: PulsarTopic
metadata:
  name: "test-pulsar-topic123"
  namespace: test
spec:
  name: persistent://test-tenant/testns/topic123
  connectionRef:
    name: "test-pulsar-connection"
# persistent: true
# partitions: 8
# maxProducers: 8
# maxConsumers: 8
# messageTTL:
# maxUnAckedMessagesPerConsumer:
# maxUnAckedMessagesPerSubscription:
# retentionTime: 20h    # or "-1" for infinite retention time
# retentionSize: 2Gi    # or "-1" for infinite retention size
# backlogQuotaLimitTime: 24h
# backlogQuotaLimitSize: 1Gi
# backlogQuotaRetentionPolicy: producer_request_hold
# lifecyclePolicy: CleanUpAfterDeletion
# compactionThreshold: 104857600  # 100MB
# persistencePolicies:
#   bookkeeperEnsemble: 3
#   bookkeeperWriteQuorum: 2
#   bookkeeperAckQuorum: 2
#   managedLedgerMaxMarkDeleteRate: "1.0"
# delayedDelivery:
#   active: true
#   tickTimeMillis: 1000
# dispatchRate:
#   dispatchThrottlingRateInMsg: 1000
#   dispatchThrottlingRateInByte: 1048576
#   ratePeriodInSecond: 1
# publishRate:
#   publishThrottlingRateInMsg: 2000
#   publishThrottlingRateInByte: 2097152
# inactiveTopicPolicies:
#   inactiveTopicDeleteMode: "delete_when_no_subscriptions"
#   maxInactiveDurationInSeconds: 3600
#   deleteWhileInactive: true
```

2. Apply the YAML file to create the topic.

```shell
kubectl apply -f topic.yaml
```

3. Check the resource status. When column Ready is true, it indicates the resource is created successfully in the pulsar cluster

```shell
kubectl -n test get pulsartopic.resource.streamnative.io
```

```shell
NAME                   RESOURCE_NAME                              GENERATION   OBSERVED_GENERATION   READY
test-pulsar-topic123   persistent://test-tenant/testns/topic123   1            1                     True
```

## Update A Pulsar Topic

You can update the topic policies by editing the `topic.yaml` file and then applying it again using `kubectl apply -f topic.yaml`. This allows you to modify various settings of the Pulsar topic.

Important notes when updating a Pulsar topic:

1. The fields `name` and `persistent` are immutable and cannot be updated after the topic is created.

2. Other fields such as `partitions`, `maxProducers`, `maxConsumers`, `messageTTL`, `retentionTime`, `retentionSize`, `backlogQuotaLimitTime`, `backlogQuotaLimitSize`, `backlogQuotaRetentionPolicy`, `compactionThreshold`, `persistencePolicies`, `delayedDelivery`, `dispatchRate`, `publishRate`, and `inactiveTopicPolicies` can be modified.

3. If you want to change the `connectionRef`, ensure that the new PulsarConnection resource exists and is properly configured. Changing the `connectionRef` can have significant implications:

   - If the new PulsarConnection refers to the same Pulsar cluster (i.e., the admin and broker URLs are the same), the topic will remain in its original location. The operator will simply use the new connection details to manage the existing topic.

   - If the new PulsarConnection points to a different Pulsar cluster (i.e., different admin and broker URLs), the operator will attempt to create a new topic with the same configuration in the new cluster. The original topic in the old cluster will not be automatically deleted.

   Be cautious when changing the `connectionRef`, especially if it points to a new cluster, as this can lead to topic duplication across clusters. Always verify the intended behavior and manage any cleanup of the old topic if necessary.

4. Changes to `lifecyclePolicy` will only affect what happens when the PulsarTopic resource is deleted, not the current state of the topic.

5. Be cautious when updating topic policies, as changes may affect existing producers and consumers. It's recommended to test changes in a non-production environment first.

6. After applying changes, you can check the status of the update using:
   ```shell
   kubectl -n test get pulsartopic.resource.streamnative.io test-pulsar-topic123
   ```
   The `OBSERVED_GENERATION` should increment, and `READY` should become `True` when the update is complete.

7. Updating the `schemaInfo` field may have implications for existing producers and consumers. Ensure that any schema changes adhere to Pulsar's schema compatibility strategies. For more information on schema evolution and compatibility, refer to the [Pulsar Schema Evolution and Compatibility](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/schema-understand#schema-evolution) documentation.

## Delete A PulsarTopic

To delete a PulsarTopic resource, use the following kubectl command:

```shell
kubectl delete pulsartopic.resource.streamnative.io test-pulsar-topic123
```

Please be aware that when you delete the topic, the actual topic will still exist in the Pulsar cluster if the `lifecyclePolicy` is set to `KeepAfterDeletion`. For more detailed information about the lifecycle policies and their implications, please refer to the [PulsarResourceLifeCyclePolicy documentation](pulsar_resource_lifecycle.md).

If you want to delete the topic in the pulsar cluster, you can use the following command:

```shell
pulsarctl topics delete persistent://test-tenant/testns/topic123
```

## Topic-Level Policies

| `ALWAYS_COMPATIBLE` | New schemas are always compatible with existing schemas |
| `BACKWARD` | New schema is compatible with the previous schema |
| `FORWARD` | Previous schema is compatible with the new schema |
| `FULL` | New schema is both backward and forward compatible |
| `BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE` | New schema is compatible with all previous schemas |
| `FORWARD_TRANSITIVE` | All previous schemas are compatible with the new schema |
| `FULL_TRANSITIVE` | New schema is backward and forward compatible with all schemas |

**Example:**
```yaml
spec:
  schemaCompatibilityStrategy: BACKWARD
```

### autoSubscriptionCreation

The `autoSubscriptionCreation` field controls whether subscriptions can be created automatically when consumers connect to the topic.

**Example:**
```yaml
spec:
  autoSubscriptionCreation:
    allowAutoSubscriptionCreation: true
```

## SchemaInfo

The `schemaInfo` field in the PulsarTopic specification allows you to define the schema for the topic. For more details about Pulsar schemas, refer to the [official documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/schema-understand/).

The `schemaInfo` field has the following structure:

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `type` | The schema type, which determines how to interpret the schema data. | Yes |
| `schema` | The schema definition. For AVRO and JSON schemas, this should be a JSON string of the schema definition. For PROTOBUF_NATIVE schemas, this should be the JSON string of protobuf definition string from [ProtobufNativeSchemaData](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/protocol/schema/ProtobufNativeSchemaData.java). | Yes |
| `properties` | A map of user-defined properties as key-value pairs. Applications can use this for carrying any application-specific logic. | No |

### Supported Schema Types

Pulsar supports various schema types, including:

- AVRO
- JSON
- PROTOBUF
- PROTOBUF_NATIVE
- THRIFT
- BOOLEAN
- INT8
- INT16
- INT32
- INT64
- FLOAT
- DOUBLE
- STRING
- BYTES
- DATE
- TIME
- TIMESTAMP
- INSTANT
- LOCAL_DATE
- LOCAL_TIME
- LOCAL_DATE_TIME

For more detailed information about these schema types and their usage, please refer to the [Pulsar Schema documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/schema-understand/).

### Example

Here's an example of a PulsarTopic resource with a JSON schema:

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.streamnative.io/v1alpha1
kind: PulsarTopic
metadata:
  name: "test-pulsar-topic123"
  namespace: test
spec:
  name: persistent://test-tenant/testns/topic123
  connectionRef:
    name: "test-pulsar-connection"
  partitions: 1
  schemaInfo:
    type: "JSON"
    schema: "{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"Example\",\"namespace\":\"test\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"ID\",\"type\":\"int\"},{\"name\":\"Name\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}"
    properties:
      "owner": "pulsar"
```

This example defines a JSON schema with two fields, `ID` and `Name`, both of which are required. The `type` field is set to `JSON`, indicating that the schema is in JSON format. The `schema` field contains the actual JSON schema definition. The `properties` field is optional and can be used to add any application-specific logic.

## Complete Example with Advanced Policies

Here's a comprehensive example of a PulsarTopic resource that demonstrates the use of the new topic-level policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.streamnative.io/v1alpha1
kind: PulsarTopic

```

This example demonstrates a production-ready topic configuration with:
- High availability persistence settings (5 bookies ensemble, 3 write quorum)
- Rate limiting for producers, consumers, subscriptions, and replicators
- Delayed delivery capability for scheduled messages  
- Automatic topic compaction at 1GB
- Inactive topic cleanup after 24 hours
- Message deduplication enabled with snapshot intervals
- JSON schema enforcement with backward compatibility
- Subscription rate limiting (5 subscriptions per consumer per 30 seconds)
- Message size limits (1MB maximum)
- Consumer and subscription limits per topic
- Custom properties for metadata tracking
- Controlled auto-subscription creation (disabled for production)
